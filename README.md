# 🎓 Transverse Project in Manufacturing — Summary of Laboratory Work

A concise summary of six laboratory investigations conducted in the context of advanced manufacturing processes, surface engineering, and surface metrology.

## 1. Powder Characterization

### Scope
Characterization of metallic powders regarding morphology, size distribution, flowability, density, and chemical composition for additive and coating applications.

### Key Outcomes
- Plasma spheroidization produces **smaller and more rounded particles** compared to gas atomization.
- Both processes show **similar densities and flowability**, with spheroidized powders presenting slightly **better flow times** and **higher apparent density**.
- Spheroidized powders exhibit:
  - improved geometric uniformity
  - reduced satellite formation
  - enhanced packing efficiency
  - better processability for manufacturing
- SEM identifies satellites on non-spheroidized particles and elemental variations in Ti-Al-V powders.
- Spheroidization leads to more consistent particle behavior for downstream processing.

## 2. Laser Cladding (LC)

### Scope
316L Stainless Steel was laser clad onto AISI 4140 alloy steel, followed by comparison with cold-sprayed coatings.

### Experimental Highlights
- Laser power: **3000 W**
- Optimal overlap: **30% at 8.5 rev/min**
- Final multilayer thickness: **~0.81 mm**
- Substrate diameter influences cladding bead geometry and dilution.

### Technical Findings
- Strong metallurgical bonding achieved with **~10 µm** dilution zone.
- No cracking or porosity in LC coatings.
- Hardness in coating > substrate due to solidification microstructures.

### Cold Spray Notes
- No thermal effects, no HAZ, no dilution.
- Severe deformation → hardness improvement.
- Some porosity observed; heat treatment would improve ductility and machinability.

## 3. Belt Finishing

### Scope
Evaluation of abrasive belt finishing effects on surface roughness of laser-clad steel using two grit sizes: **80 µm** and **40 µm**.

### Observations
- Decreasing grain size and increasing finishing duration both decrease roughness values.
- Largest reduction occurs within the first **10–20 seconds**, then stabilizes into a plateau.
- Plateau surfaces improve bearing load capability and lubrication retention.
- Study confirms belt finishing as a viable superfinishing step for LC surfaces.
- Suggested future work: residual stress and microstructural alteration analysis.

## 4. Ball Burnishing

### Scope
Comparison of turned surfaces and ball-burnished surfaces at multiple feed rates.

### Results
- Burnishing significantly reduces **Ra, Rz, Rk, Rpk, Rvk** values compared to turning.
- Lower feed theoretically → lower roughness; partially confirmed.
- On LC surfaces, feed reduction to **0.05 mm/rev** produced roughness increase due to surface non-homogeneity.
- Lack of substrate data at same feed prevents definitive trend confirmation.

### Conclusion
Ball burnishing is an effective process for surface finish optimization; further low-feed experimentation is recommended.

## 5. Surface Topography Characterization

### Scope
3D measurements using Confocal Microscopy and Focus Variation Microscopy for belt-finished and burnished surfaces.

### Findings
- Increasing feed increases **Ra**, while **Rz** shows non-linear variation for burnishing.
- Differences between 2D profilometer and 3D microscopy due to:
  - metrology principle differences
  - Gaussian filter settings (0.6 vs. 0.8)
- Belt-finished surfaces observed slightly rougher than burnished ones.
- Negative **Ssk** indicates valley-dominant topography.
- Waviness and roughness persist even on visually shiny surfaces.

# 📌 Overall Technical Conclusions

- Powder morphology and densification strongly influence coating and manufacturing performance.
- Laser cladding delivers metallurgically bonded coatings with enhanced hardness, while cold spray maintains substrate integrity with mechanical bonding.
- Post-clad finishing processes (belt finishing & ball burnishing) significantly modify surface function, reducing roughness and improving bearing/tribological performance.
- 3D topography measurements provide richer insights than 2D profilometry, especially regarding filtering effects and surface functional parameters.
